Git merge and rebase


Merge: is an action that when you have changes in master and also in other branch and you want to add the changes from master to the other branch
move to the other branch with -  git checkout “branch name” 
git merge master

git merge
- Is a non-destructive operation
- Existing branches are not changed in any way
- Creates a new merge commit in the feature branch


Rebase: is an action that 
is an action that when you have changes in master and also in other branch and you want to add the changes from master to the other branch.
The difference is that it is moving the branch point to the time of the rebuild
move to the other branch with -  git checkout “branch name” 
git rebase master

git rebase
- Moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch
- Re-writes the project history
- We get much cleaner and linear project history
